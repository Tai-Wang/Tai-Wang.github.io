I am a Ph.D. student of [MMLab](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/) (Multimedia Laboratory), [The Chinese University of Hong Kong](https://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html), supervised by [Dahua Lin](http://dahua.site/). Previously I spent four wonderful years and obtained my Bachelor's Degree at [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/english/). I am excited about all the vision or AI technologies that can really change people's lifestyle, for example, building intelligent agents that can interact with us. My current research is mainly focused on general 3D perception, including different modalities, tasks and scenarios. I am also interested in other 3D vision tasks, such as 3D mesh generation, point cloud completion and general 3D representation learning.

News
----------
- Our follow-up work based on FCOS3D, [PGD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2107.14160), is released. Check out our paper for the exhaustive study on the dominant role of depth estimation in the monocular 3D detection.
- The paper of our study that bridges 2D detection and monocular 3D detection, [FCOS3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.10956), has been released. The code is also available at [MMDet3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d).
- Our further research on voxel representation learning, [Cylinder3D](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10033), is accepted by CVPR 2021! We also obtained the runner-up in the nuScenes LiDAR Segmentation Challenge.
- MMDet3D Team wins the Best PKL Award and best vision-only results in the 3rd nuScenes detection challenge of 5th AI Driving Olympics, NeurIPS 2020.
- We release our full technical report for our previously developed LiDAR annotation tool, [FLAVA](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.10174). The report reveals some really interesting findings and thinkings.
- Our work [Reconfigurable Voxels](https://arxiv.org/abs/2004.02724) is accepted to CoRL 2020. Looking forward to more research on voxel representation learning for non-uniformly distributed point clouds.
- [MMDetection3D](https://github.com/open-mmlab/mmdetection3d) is finally released! Fork this versatile codebase and have a try, pushing forward this field to general 3D detection together.
